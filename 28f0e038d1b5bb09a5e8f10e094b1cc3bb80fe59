The goal would be to expose the pieces of the message required through typed interfaces, rather than giving this \"raw\" access to the direct API.  If you could articulate what you\u0027re trying to do with the message, we could likely give you more pointers on how best to go about doing that.",

      "message": "What I need is the sender, but I thought that giving access to the entire message would be more flexible and allow other users to get other things.\n\nI noticed though that sdbusplus has its own `message_t` wrapper around the message, I updated the review to use that instead. Is that what you meant, or should I add a method for getting the sender specifically? (With my latest changes it\u0027s possible to get the sender with `get_current_message().get_sender()` which I think is fine.)",
