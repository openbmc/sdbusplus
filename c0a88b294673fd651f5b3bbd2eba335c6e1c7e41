It was my intention to ultimately deprecate the boost::coroutine based things (given that they were depcreated even in boost before these were written).\n\nMy understanding was there were only two applications using them (telemetry and one other) upstream, and those could be moved over to either the c++20 coroutines, or callbacks.  Was your usage one of those applications?",

Was your usage one of those applications?\n\nIn ipmid, the coroutine stuff is heavily used (see https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid/blob/master/ipmid-new.cpp#L767);\nIn our downstream code, we added several oem handler in `bmcweb` that uses a lot of coroutine stuff to make the code more readable. (bmcweb by default uses the callback style and it is complicated if we have multiple level of callbacks.)",
