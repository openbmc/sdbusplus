      "message": "The commit message became rather long due to moving the relevant parts of the original RFC cover letter to it and adding the testing description. I can trim it down if it\u0027s too verbose.\n\nI extended the implementation to cover reading and writing properties in addition to method implementations and added a couple of simple unit tests to verify that bus::process*() rethrow the current exception.",

The compile failure is due to name collision between a \u0027Bus\u0027 property in an interface YAML and this property.  `_sdbusplus_bus` is probably fine.\n\nI\u0027d rather not store both the interface and the bus.  If we now need the bus, which is fine, we should remove the interface and obtain the interface from the bus when we need.",

Split that into its own commit as it\u0027s an independent simple refactor that doesn\u0027t change any existing functionality. Hopefully passes the CI now.",
