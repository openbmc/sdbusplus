I don’t fully understand where the people involved would like to see we end up. \n\nIt is fine for you and your team to be doing experimentation and gathering data. Ultimately, we need a design document of where we want to go, how we’re going to get there, and what the alternatives are. I don’t think we’re ever going to merge a fundamental change, like setting all dbus vtables to unprivileged, without having that bigger discussion. Trying to discuss that in this code review doesn’t seem like the right venue.",

And like you said we can take discussion of running bmcweb as non-root somewhere in discord and not in this PR. \n\nOn a quick summery to run bmcweb as non root we need the following:\n1) Make a non root user and give the required file access.\n2) Move libpam functionality from bmcweb to a different demon \n3) Make changes in this PR + dbus conf files to let non-root user make dbus calls.\n\nLike you suggested we can make a design document and share with all details.",
