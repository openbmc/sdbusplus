      "message": "I\u0027d still like to see an example of something real actually made better by this compared to just declaring a setter/getter.  As an interface, this patchset isn\u0027t type safe, so I really don\u0027t think we should merge it as is, and having it exist on master prevents cleaning up the other non typesafe interface (set_property).  If it were made typesafe, I could see it being ok as an extension, but IMO the existing patterns IMO are better.\n\nIf there really isn\u0027t anyone that wants to maintain this, I guess I can throw my name in the ring (although I don\u0027t particularly want to maintain more thing).  It\u0027s not that much code in addition to what I already maintain.",
