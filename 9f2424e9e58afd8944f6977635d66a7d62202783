      "message": "\u003e Did you test this being built against openbmc/openbmc?\n\nYes, openbmc master builds just fine.  I built S7106, but I\u0027d assume all the other targets would build as well.  I ran through a couple redfish commands (just because that\u0027s what I have set up, not because it\u0027s the best possible test) just to make sure the basic read/append things work, and it seems to work just fine.\n\n\u003e  If this were the write path, I wouldn\u0027t expect it to work, since there would be a lot of `const foo`s that don\u0027t match the `is_same` checks, but since this is the read path maybe it works fine.\n\nAgreed.  In the write path, I would expect we\u0027d need to do a std::decay_v on the main template param to get rid of the const/volatileness to deduplicate the parameters, but I haven\u0027t looked at that much yet.  For whatever reason, the Append path doesn\u0027t show up in compile-time profiles as much, but I intend to do that at some point.",
