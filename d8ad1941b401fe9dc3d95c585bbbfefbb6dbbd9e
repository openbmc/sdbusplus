      "message": "FYI, I\u0027ve also pushed my WIP for having a \"Dbus property\" object that could accept sets, and is the reason I\u0027m asking hard questions on this patchset.  It removes the need for std::any.  If we wanted to add get() to that it would be trivial, but I\u0027d still like to see a use case where it makes the code clearer compared to just specifying a setter and a getter.\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/sdbusplus/+/64732",
