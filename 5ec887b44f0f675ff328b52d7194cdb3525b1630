A philosophy that\u0027s been bandied about is if the data you\u0027re exchanging on D-Bus isn\u0027t human-consumable in a `busctl introspect` or `busctl monitor` then there are probably better approaches. For instance, in this case an alternative is to use D-Bus\u0027 [file descriptor type (`h`)](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#basic-types) along with [memfd_create(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html) to pass a descriptor for a memory region between processes. This would avoid the problem altogether.",
