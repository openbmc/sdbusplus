      "message": "Are you asking why the whole change-set was done or the alias specifically?  The whole change-set I\u0027m pretty sure I gave an explanation for the rationale in the commit message.  This greatly simplifies the code and makes the namespaces much more obvious.  The old code had to do a bunch of \"split string, insert \u0027server\u0027 in the second-to-last position, and join\".  It was painful and spread across multiple place.  I\u0027m writing the client and async bindings now so I want to avoid spreading this pain further.\n\nThe alias is done because I want to have a migration path for existing code rather than break the universe today.  `openbmc/openbmc` still compiles with this change as long as the alias is there.  I put if-def guards around it so that on a per-repository basis we can `-DSDBUSPP_REMOVE_DEPRECATED_NAMESPACE` and fix what is broken.  This allows people to do it over a ~6 month window.\n\nI\u0027ll send an email to the mailing list informing about this change when it merges.",
