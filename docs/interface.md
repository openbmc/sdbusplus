# Interface YAML

D-Bus interfaces can be defined by creating a YAML file to describe the
methods, properties, and signals they contain.  From this YAML file,
both documentation and binding code may be generated.

## YAML sections

An interface YAML may have the following sections:

* description
    - A small documentation section describing the purpose of the
      interface.
* methods
    - A list of methods provided by this D-Bus interface.
* properties
    - A list of properties provided by this D-Bus interface.
* signals
    - A list of signals generated by this D-Bus interface.
* enumerations
    - A list of enumerations defined by this D-Bus interface.

## Enumerations

A common problem we have found with D-Bus interfaces is having a consistent
way to define enumerations.  Two common practices are to either assign
special meaning to integers, as a C compiler might do, or to have specific
strings representing the enumeration name.  The [D-Bus API design guidelines](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-api-design.html)
specify both of these options:

> For APIs being used in constrained situations, enumerated values should be
> transmitted as unsigned integers. For APIs which need to be extended by
> third parties or which are used in more loosely coupled systems, enumerated
> values should be strings in some defined format.

What we have done in `sdbus++` is to consider enumerations as a first-class
type.  Within an interface you can define an enumeration and the bindings
will have a C++ enumeration defined for it.  At a D-Bus level any property or
method parameter will be a string, but the string will contain a
fully-qualified name "interface.enum-name.enum-value" like
"org.freedesktop.Example.Color.Red".  Within the generated bindings, an
automatic conversion is done between strings and C++ enumeration values and
clients will get an "xyz.openbmc_project.sdbusplus.Error.InvalidEnumString"
error response if they attempt to use an invalid string value.

An enumeration must have the YAML properties `name` and `values` and may
optionally contain a `description`.  The `name` is a word corresponding to
the desired "enum-name" portion of the fully-qualified name and the resulting
C++ enum type.  The `values` are a list of enumeration values each containing
their own `name` and optional `description`.

Example:
```
enumerations:
    - name: Suits
      description: >
        The suits found in a deck of cards.
      values:
        - name: Diamonds
        - name: Hearts
        - name: Clubs
          description: >
            This is the suit that looks like a clover.
        - name: Spades
```

## Types

### Base types
Types are identified in YAML using their typename found in the
[D-Bus specification](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html),
but listed using lowercases: `int64` instead of `INT64` or C++ `int64_t`.

* byte
* boolean
* int16
* uint16
* ...
* uint64
* double
* string
* object_path
* signature

### Containers
Container types can also be expressed, but the contained-type should be
expressed within square-brackets `[]`.  The following containers are supported:

* `array[type]`
    - C++ type is `std::vector`
* `struct[type0, type1, ...]`
    - C++ type is `std::tuple`
* `variant[type0, type1, ...]`
    - C++ type is `std::variant`
* `dict[keytype, valuetype]`
    - C++ type is `std::map`

It may seem odd that variants are required to list the types they may contain,
but this is due to C++ being a strongly-typed language.  In order to generate
bindings, to read from and append to a message, the binding generator must
know all possible types the variant may contain.

### Enumerations
Enumerations are expressed like a container, but the contained-type is an
identifier of the fully-qualified enum-name or a shortened `self.` identifier
for locally defined types.

* enum[org.freedesktop.Example.Suits]
* enum[self.Suits]

## Methods

A method must have the YAML property `name` and may optionally have `flags`,
`parameters`, `returns`, `errors`, and `description`.  Flags are a list of
sd-bus flags featuring `deprecated`, 'hidden', `unprivileged` and `no_reply`.
Each parameter must have a `name`, `type`, and optional `description`.  Each
return must have a `type` and may optionally have a `name` and `description`.
Errors are a list of fully-qualified or shortened `self.` identifiers for errors
the method may return, which must be defined in a corresponding errors YAML file.

Example:
```
methods:
    - name: Shuffle
      flags:
        - unprivileged
      errors:
        - self.Error.TooTired
    - name: Deal
      description: >
        Deals a new hand to each player.
      errors:
        - self.Error.OutOfCards
    - name: LookAtTop
      returns:
        - name: Card
          type: struct[enum[self.Suit], byte]
    - name: MoveToTop
      flags:
        - unprivileged
        - no_reply
      parameters:
        - name: Card
          type: struct[enum[self.Suit], byte]
```

## Properties

A property must have the YAML property `name` and `type` and may optionally
have `description`, `default`, and `flags`.

The `default` defines the default value of the property.

The `flags` are a list of sd-bus flags featuring `deprecated`, `hidden`,
`unprivileged`, `const`, `emits_change`, `emits_invalidation`, `explicit`
and a `readonly`. The flag `readonly` prohibits the client from changing
the property. If `const` is set, `readonly` is implied.

Example:
```
properties:
    - name: CardsRemaining
      type: uint32
      default: 52
      flags:
        - const
      description: >
        The number of cards remaining in the deck.
```

## Signals

A signal must have the YAML property `name` and may optionally have a
`description` and list of `properties`.  Properties are specified the same
as interface properties.

Example:
```
signals:
    - name: Shuffled
      description: >
        The deck has been shuffled.
    - name: Cheated
      properties:
        - name: CardToTop
          type: struct[enum[self.Suit], byte]
```
