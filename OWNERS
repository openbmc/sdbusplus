# OWNERS
# ------
#
# The OWNERS file maintains the list of individuals responsible for various
# parts of this repository, including code review and approval.  We use the
# Gerrit 'owners' plugin, which consumes this file, along with some extra
# keywords for our own purposes and tooling.
#
# For details on the configuration used by 'owners' see:
#  https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/owners/+/refs/heads/master/owners/src/main/resources/Documentation/config.md
#
# An OWNERS file must be in the root of a repository but may also be present
# in any subdirectory.  The contents of the subdirectory OWNERS file are
# combined with parent directories unless 'inherit: false' is set.
#
# The owners file is YAML and has [up to] 4 top-level keywords.
#   * owners: A list of individuals who have approval authority on the
#     repository.
#
#   * reviewers: A list of individuals who have requested review notification
#     on the repository.
#
#   * matchers: A list of specific file/path matchers for granular 'owners' and
#     'reviewers'.  See 'owners' plugin documentation.
#
#   * openbmc: A list of openbmc-specific meta-data about owners and reviewers.
#     - name: preferred name of the individual.
#     - email: preferred email address of the individual.
#     - discord: Discord nickname of the individual.
#
# It is expected that these 4 sections will be listed in the order above and
# data within them will be kept sorted.
