      "message": "I probably should at least move this over into the cpp file.\n\nIs there some reason you want to make sure it is pure?  I was trying to make sure that the systemd default was preserved and it seemed better to make that happen by providing a non-pure default.  If I make this pure-virtual, we have to have hundreds of default functions in the generated code (phosphor-dbus-interfaces) that simply returns EIO.",
