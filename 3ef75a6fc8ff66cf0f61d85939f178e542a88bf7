This template is going to duplicate the function for both const and non-const parameters.  I wonder if we put a std::decay_t\u003cT\u003e here if we\u0027d get closer to the same binary size as the type erased version?\n\nJust a guess, doesn\u0027t need to be done, I still think this patchset is good enough as-is.",
