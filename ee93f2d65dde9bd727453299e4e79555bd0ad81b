      "message": "FWIW, the async version of add match didn\u0027t exist in sd-bus when we did the asio extensions initially.  We\u0027ve known about this \"bug\" for a while, but given that the dbus daemon responds pretty quickly, it wasn\u0027t a huge issue in practice.\n\nI agree, it\u0027s probably time to fix it.\n\nWe probably need an async capable match_t in the asio namespace, that accepts a callback like the asio extensions would expect.  We should look at signals_set https://live.boost.org/doc/libs/1_84_0/doc/html/boost_asio/reference/signal_set.html\n\nAs a reference for how to do these callbacks and propagate errors on asio callbacks, including the queue.\n\nI\u0027ve mocked up what that could look like here:\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/sdbusplus/+/68959\n\nFeel free to incorporate it into your patch, or take over mine.",
