Accessing privileged information on DBUS\n2. Accessing privileged information on the system e.g. filesystem.\n\nMy contention is, no matter what the default, this change is better in one scenario and no worse in the other (since everything else runs as root anyways). \n\nThe answer to what should be a default will depend on, is there anything on the D-Bus worth protecting from non-root?
