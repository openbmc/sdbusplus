I understand the situation a lot better after reading this.\n\nI\u0027m concerned about a frustrating experience for someone who might be using the SDK or something like the openbmc-test docker image to do development on this repository.  It is fairly non-obvious to be using tools from outside the repository when they exist in the repository.\n\nIs there something we can do instead to detect a cross-compile situation and only do that in that case?  I think meson gives us that facility.\n\n(I am curious where you ran into this though because we didn\u0027t have the problem with the Yocto build)",
