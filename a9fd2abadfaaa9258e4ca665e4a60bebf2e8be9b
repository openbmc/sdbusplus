      "message": "The point was to create a type safe abstraction to differentiate the meaning of no provided timeout from a valid timeout value. sd-bus obviously just uses an int under the hood, and 0 made sense as a sentinel for `default` given that 0 isn\u0027t really a useful value.\n\n\nI don\u0027t feel too strongly about keeping it this way, as sd-bus uses 0 and it might be clear to most readers that timing out immediately wouldn\u0027t make sense.",

      "message": "I originally put these functions on the bus to limit how much the message needed to break through the abstraction and get to the bus object itself (bus uses message and message uses bus).  Unfortunately, there were a few cases where it wasn\u0027t possible, like the \u0027method_return\u0027 function.  If you look back at commit \u00274c3427c2~1\u0027 before all the interface abstraction was put in, you\u0027ll see the only case where we had to access the bus object was in the \u0027method_return\u0027 function.\n\nIf we\u0027re going to add this \u0027call\u0027 here, you could make an argument that every method in bus that operates on a message should / could be moved into message itself.  Doing that requires this extra kind of lookup though.\n\nIs there some use case where the syntax of calling on the message object improves things significantly for the developer?  Is it worth the expense of the extra lookup?  If so, is there any reason to not move all the similar methods over here as well?",

      "message": "I have instances where messages are decoupled from the bus they were created on and it would be nicer to not have to associate the two things when the message already implicitly knows the associated bus. It turns out we don\u0027t even have to do the lookup at all and the internal code for doing the lookup should be faster than even passing in a bus pointer.",
