      "message": "I\u0027m not sure how it is useful to use the same callback for install as event.\n\nTypically you want to:\n1. install a match\n2. check for the presence / absence of an object and do something about it\n\nYou really can\u0027t do #2 until you know #1 is done, otherwise you\u0027re likely to miss the event you really wanted to see.  If I can\u0027t explicitly stop #2, then I might be late at installing the match and early at observing the state (or vice versa) and assume the wrong state forever.\n\nThis is the same problem I was trying to convey to LeiYU in his attempt at this.",
