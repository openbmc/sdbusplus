      "message": "This stuff if ripe for some simplification.  The block of code this is changing is almost 100% duplicated with the method of the same name above it, and that duplicated block already comments out the message argument.  Unless I\u0027m missing something, all 4 of those methods could be collapsed into:\n    template \u003ctypename T\u003e\n    void callFunction(message_t\u0026 m, InputTupleType\u0026 inputArgs)\n    {\n        ResultType \u003d r \u003d std::apply(func_, inputArgs);\n        if constexpr(!std::is_void_v\u003cT\u003e){\n            m.append(r);\n        }\n    }\n\n\nNothing to be done in the context of this commit, but I\u0027ll take a look at that file and see if we can simplify some of the templates a bit.  They\u0027ve devolved a lot since they were originally written.",
