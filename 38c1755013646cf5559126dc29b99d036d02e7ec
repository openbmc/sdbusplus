Lets get written down what you\u0027re trying to accomplish, and we can go from there, but I really suspect that this isn\u0027t the right place for this generic, non dbus specific code.",

      "message": "Ideally either:\n   1. stdexec would handle sd_events\n   2. we would have a separate library to make sd_events async.\n\n(1) isn\u0027t the case today and isn\u0027t likely to be the case.\n(2) would require we split out a bunch of stuff around stdexec into a separate library that sdbusplus could build on top of, since sdbusplus also needs to handle some sd_events async code.\n\nI know there is sdeventplus; maybe this could live there.  We already have some existing sd_event and timer support in this library, so I don\u0027t think leveraging that was a big stretch.  It seems like fairly minor code that I\u0027m relatively ok with it living here for the time being until this space matures more.",

I find it unlikely that we\u0027ll ever clean this up, and doing this same pattern of allowing things to rely on classes put in the wrong location in the past (timers, cough) has caused the project pain.
