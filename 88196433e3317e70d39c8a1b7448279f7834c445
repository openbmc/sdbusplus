I was trying to ensure we had constexpr values where possible and handle both c-string and string.  I\u0027m annoyed by how often I see callers of this library having to do \u0027c_str()\u0027 in seemingly random places so I\u0027d like to consolidate on something consistent.",

I followed what seems to be used in the string_view API itself.\n\nhttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view/operator%3D\n\nI can certainly change them to pass-by-value though.  I think it\u0027ll have minimal impact.  Will follow up with another commit.",
