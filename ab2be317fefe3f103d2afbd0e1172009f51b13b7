      "message": "\u003e Can the needed support just be baked into sdeventplus?\n\nI don\u0027t have opinions on that yet.  I should probably be explicit but I\u0027m treating this currently as an internal-only API.\n\nI am hoping that for the vast majority of our applications they really don\u0027t need to know anything about the underlying event servicing when they switch to a co-routine programming model.  I didn\u0027t want to take on the dependency yet until I figure out what all is needed and I didn\u0027t want some dual direction dependency where the task/context is in sdbusplus and other parts of the support are in sdeventplus.  Maybe as this gets further along it\u0027ll make sense to move some of the lower-level coroutine aspects into sdeventplus instead.",
