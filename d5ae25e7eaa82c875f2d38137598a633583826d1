      "message": "\u003e Do you have an example \n\nThe testcase has an example ((debug) log message).\n\nAnother case would be retrofitting PDI onto existing boost asio reactors, without re-writing a bunch of stuff.\n\nBasically staying within what\u0027s possible to do with \u0027Inspection only\u0027.\n\n\u003e For PDI enabled repos, they don\u0027t need access to this, right?\n\nProbably not, but i don\u0027t want to force a single way to use PDI onto people...\n\nFolks should probably use the conversion functions, but i see PDI also as a way of exposing information about D-Bus interfaces to other code, which includes the representations of enum values on D-Bus.\n\nMaybe someone will find a creative use for them, otherwise i can use these to retrofit existing code. Maybe at some point it will be obsolete to expose them.",
