# Error YAML

D-Bus errors can be defined by creating a YAML file to describe the errors.
From this YAML file, both documentation and binding code may be generated.
The generated bindings are C++ exception types corresponding to the D-Bus
error name. Ex. `org.freedesktop.Example.Error.SomeError` will create a
generated exception type of
`sdbusplus::org::freedesktop::Example::Error::SomeError` which may be thrown
or caught as appropriate. If the error is thrown from an interface method
which has specified it may return that error, then the bindings will generate
a catch clause that returns a D-Bus error like
"org.freedesktop.Example.Error.SomeError" to the method caller.

The error YAML is simply a list of `name` along with optional `description`
and `errno` properties.
Example:

```yaml
- name: SomeError
- name: AnotherError
  description: >
    This is another error.
  errno: E2BIG
```
