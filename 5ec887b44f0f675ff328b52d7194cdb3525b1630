      "message": "That\u0027s bad and optimising sdbusplus is a good outcome, but I do wonder whether the design is wrong. A philosophy that\u0027s been bandied about is if the data you\u0027re exchanging on D-Bus isn\u0027t human-consumable in a `busctl introspect` or `busctl monitor` then there are probably better approaches. For instance, in this case an alternative is to use D-Bus\u0027 [file descriptor type (`h`)](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#basic-types) along with [memfd_create(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html) to pass a descriptor for a memory region between processes. This would avoid the problem altogether.",

      "message": "Hi, Andrew,\nThank you for reviewing.  \n\nI generally agree to your comment/approach.  \n\nBut since here sdbusplus exposes this as a generic interface -- there\u0027s no good way to prevent sdbusplus client code to \"abuse\" it ...\n\nTaking the host CPU booting over I3C use case I am referring to here, the better approach is clearly a shared memory (implemented with memfd_create, passing the fd over UNIX socket/D-Bus) between MCTPD and PLDMD for the whole CPU boot image (in 20MB size or even larger), instead of sending it piece by piece over IPC call (like 5000 calls for the whole boot).\n\nBased on the fact that we can not force client code to not use this interface (passing vector/array of integral over D-Bus/sdbusplus), I think this is a valid optimization approach -- while creating a mem fd inside this, passing it to peer for every package (create fd -\u003e send fd -\u003e close fd for 5000 times) looks a overkill, and may introduce more performance burden.\n\nHow do you think?\nThanks!\nYongbing",

      "message": "Right, I\u0027m not suggesting your patch shouldn\u0027t be merged. We should absolutely optimise sdbusplus where we can.\n\nI recognise that the application design at this point might be hard to change, and you need to make the best of what you have, and that we\u0027d need concrete performance numbers on each approach to evaluate them properly. But with that in mind, it\u0027s generally recommended that large chunks of data be passed over D-Bus by file descriptor to avoid these kinds of performance problems.\n\nIt also seems you have an MCTP integration that is very much not something we\u0027re doing upstream, and you\u0027d also not have the problem upstream if you used `AF_MCTP` sockets for PLDM instead :) But again I expect you\u0027re in position where you have to make the best of what you have.",
