I can disable the warning if you\u0027d rather, it just seemed less controversial than I thought, which is why I didn\u0027t add a huge explanation to the commit message.  Sorry for that.",

      "message": "\"want the symbols exposed\"?  None of this is going into the shared library.  The linker should already handle the symbol visibility fine without this.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t have a problem if this was specifically about reducing the library symbol visibility because the linker is incapable of figuring it out on its own.  I don\u0027t want to see a precedent where every single .C file through out the org is required to have noisy \u0027static\u0027 on every single function.  It doesn\u0027t provide value.",
