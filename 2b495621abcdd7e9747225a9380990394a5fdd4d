At least the first issue should be fixed now.\n\nDidn\u0027t see a Jenkinsfile in the repo, so I looked briefly into openbmc-build-scripts to see what the CI pipeline looks like and expects so that I could take the checks into account and maybe even pre-run some of the steps locally, but didn\u0027t yet locate the pipeline other than maybe run-unit-test-docker.sh.",
