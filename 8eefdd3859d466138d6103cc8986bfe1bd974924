      "message": "Looking again at it, it looks like the ObjectManager is who emits the signal, so a path match would be on the ObjectManager path. Since OMs are rarely at a specific required position in the tree, I suspect most of these current matches are \"wrong\" from a \"right way to do dbus\" perspective but might actually have worked due to tight coupling with a particular implementation. \n\nWe will need to audit all uses before I merge this, even though I suspect that this change is probably the more useful implementation.",
