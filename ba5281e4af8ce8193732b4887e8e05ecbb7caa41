      "message": "Overall, it allows clang to pass with -Winconsistent-missing-override.  Yes, on destruction, this annotation is kind of useless, but does allow us to catch missing override keywords on non-destructors, so it seems (at least to me) that adding useless boilerplate to these was a good idea to get the benefit in other places.",
